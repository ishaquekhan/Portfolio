						for learning more complex languages, like Python and JavaScript. You can view and play this Scratch game by

							<p style="color:white" class="caption">This was our second main project of the year, our task 
							was to modify a basic, prebuilt android app on the MIT App Inventor platform. App Inventor was similar to Scratch in the way that it used 
							the same "drag-and-drop" style of coding. The goal of this project was to put our skills learned in Scratch up to face  challenge in order 
							to enhance and perfect them. My partner and I had our app take on the task of stopping people from texting while driving, posing a serious 
							threat to themselves and others while on the road. We included features like an auto-reply system and an editable auto-reply message, along 
							with a camera feature. You can view our project log, download the source code and finished app for both our beta version and final version, if

							<p style="color:white" class="caption"> This was our first project this year dealing with the programming language Python. We had done a 
							lot of activites on the basic use and syntax of Pyrhon, and a few Codecademy courses to supplement this. The goal of this project was to
							help build basic Python skills like defining and calling functions, getting user input within a function and executing certain features 
							based off of it, using global and local variables, conditional statements, and creating docstrings and comments. My partner and I created 
							an adventure about someone being trapped inside of a room, and the player must help them escape by making a wide variety of different choices, 
							each affecting the overall outcome of the adventure. We made the last part of the adventure very similar to an open-world game, where the 
							user can pick which areas to explore and find objects to use in other areas, creating a more game-like, adventurous tone. You can take a look

							<p style="color:white" class="caption"> This was our final project of the 2015-2016 school year. We were required to come up a new idea
							for an app, product, or concept and turn it into reality by using our skills learned this year and in previous engineering courses. My partner
							and I came up with the idea of modular, self-sustaining homes. Our home came with customizable sizing and a variety of renewable energy sources, 
							which solved the problem of expensive housing and high living costs. Because we obviously could not build a full size model of our idea, we used
							Autodesk Invetor 2016 in order to create a 3D model which accurately represented the idea we had in mind. If you would like to view more details

							<p style="color:white" class="caption">This was our final major project of AP Computer Science A. Our task was to find a problem in today's world and create a solution. 
							I came up with the idea of long range wireless charging which could be used with electric vehicles and/or hybrids. Current solutions do not provide a reasonable way of 
							tackling this problem, as they try to use the same wireless charging technology as smartphones. In order for this solution to be viable, new wireless technology must be used.
							For this reason, I decided to use a wireless power transfer system involving lenses, laser designators, and photocell receptors. In short, this method utilizes high frequency 
							electromagnetic waves that are refracted into beams than can be aimed at photocell receptors on individual vehicles thanks to the laser designators. A picture of  my device in Autodesk Inventor

							<p style="color:white" class="caption">This was the second major project of Digital Electronics. This project required 
							me to think of a situation where AOI Logic could be implemented. I thought of the college admissions process, and the fact 
							that a student may want some closure after applying to gain a rough estimate based on whether or not he or she got in. The 
							circuit I designed had four inputs, test scores, grades, essays, and extracurricular activities, which are all crucial to the 
							admissions process. The circuit will output an estimate of whether or not a particular student got in. A truth table was then 
							developed and a logic expression was derived from it. Next, the logic expression was simplified and turned into a MultiSim file 
							to simulate the proposed circuit. After verifying the circuit's functionality in MultiSim, it was breadboarded. My project's documentation
