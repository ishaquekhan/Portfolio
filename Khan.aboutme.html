						<p style="color:white" class="aboutmep"> At the current moment, I am a senior enrolled in Dublin High
						School, in Dublin, California. Ever since my early childhood, I have been thoroughly 
						fascinated by computers and all they could do. After the first time I experienced using
						a computer, I have dreamed of becoming a software engineer, making programs and applications 
						that people use every day of their lives. Because of this dream, I have made many steps toward 
						achieving my ultimate goal. I took CSE (Computer Science and Software Engineering) 
						during sophomore year and took AP Computer Science A during my junior year. These classes have helped 
						me develop my foundation in the basics of computer science. </p>
						<p style="color:white" class="aboutmep"> In order to achieve my goal of becoming a computer scientist, there are 
						certain qualities I have developed throughout the pursuit of my dream. By far, the most 
						important of these qualities have been sheer determination and perseverance. Those qualities are the 
						reason I am still in pursuit of my objective. Without them, I would not have a reason to do what I do.
