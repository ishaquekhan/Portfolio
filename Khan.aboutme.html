						<p style="color:white" class="aboutmep"> Growing up in Silicon Valley, I was lucky to be exposed to the forefront of modern technology. Seeing the successes of tech giants in my backyard, I developed an interest in computer science from an early age. I taught myself how to write programs in Python at age twelve and got my first website off the ground when I was thirteen. 
						Speaking in terms of the classroom, I chose to take Computer Science and Software Engineering during my sophomore year in order to become more familiar with commonly used programming and markup languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This class helped me solidify my core foundation in the basics of computer science. In my junior year, I took AP Computer Science A to become familiar with the conceptual side of object-oriented programming and applied these skills in Java, particularly in the form of Android applications. I used the skills I learned when I developed my Discord bot. </p>
						<p style="color:white" class="aboutmep"> Starting my own business gave me an opportunity to apply my computer programming skills. As a co-founder of HELIOS, I designed a jacket that allows for wireless, solar-powered charging of phones. In order to legitimize the business, I developed a website using HTML, CSS, and vueJS in order to make the site functional while looking polished and user-friendly. 
						As an intern at the Silicon Valley Education Foundation (SVEF) last summer, I saw how computer science education is driven and promoted in the Bay Area for students just like me. Aside from supporting public education, I had the opportunity to evaluate the functionality of a data collection algorithm written by a colleague that would be applied to SVEFâ€™s student programming. I did this by analyzing patterns and contents of data produced by the algorithm.</p>
						<p style="color:white" class="aboutmep"> Ultimately, I am interested in continuing my education in computer science because I have seen the versatility of its applications in many different fields. Pursuing my interest in computer science will allow me to achieve my goal of furthering the applications of artificial intelligence. Taking part in these activities have further peaked my interest in computer science.</p>
						<p style="color:white" class="aboutmep"> Thank you for taking the time to get to know a little bit more about me, my goals, and my interests. If you are interested in learning more about my engineering experiences, please feel free to explore the rest of my online portfolio!</p>
